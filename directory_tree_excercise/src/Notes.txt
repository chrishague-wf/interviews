- Intro Level Programmer should notice : 

*Method one is and infinite loop as curFile is never set to anything else
*Method two will break if curFile does not have children files (null pointer)
*Method three is recursive

- Mid Level Programmer should notice : 

*Method one will break (null pointer) if given an invalid file path
*Method two is breadth first
*Method two will only go as deep as the FIRST child of any directory 
   (as opposed to printing all the files) - curFile.children[0]
*Method three is depth first

- Senior Level Programmer should notice : 

*Method one never prints the file if the path given is not a directory
*Method two only has null check safety on the first file path given
*None of the methods provide a parameter for depth (i.e : you can't specify how deep you want the list to go)

- Other notes :

*No unit tests !
*None of the methods return the string in case you want to manipulate / format it elsewhere
*See if they can modify method three to be breadth first
*There should helper methods for printing like printDir() or printFile() so that there are not a lot of 
    System.out.damn_this_is_cumborsome_to_type_over_and_over();
